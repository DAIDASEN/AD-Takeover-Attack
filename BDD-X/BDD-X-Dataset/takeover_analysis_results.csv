The need to adjust speed and position due to another vehicle intruding into the lane introduces a level of unpredictability and potential risk that qualifies as a difficult scenario requiring human oversight."
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sq8geewpqu/samples-1k/06d54ae6-bf7ed032.mov,7,22.0s - 23.0s,The car is abruptly slowing,"This action involves a sudden, unexpected maneuver to avoid a pothole at full speed, which qualifies as a difficult scenario due to the adverse road condition and the abrupt nature of the response. Such situations may require human judgment to assess road surface hazards and execute safer evasive actions, especially if the pothole was not clearly detectable or required lane deviation."
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sq8geewpqu/samples-1k/01c3e19a-fbacb266.mov,11,32.0s - 40.0s,The car is slowing,"The vehicle exhibits uncertainty regarding another vehicle's behavior, indicating an ambiguous or potentially unsafe situation. Per the criteria, actions based on uncertainty (""seems uncertain"") require human intervention as they reflect a lack of confidence in navigating dynamic traffic interactions, which can escalate quickly and demand immediate judgment."
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sq8geewpqu/samples-1k/03370efc-c690f4d8.mov,20,21.0s - 25.0s,The car swerves to the left and slows,"This action involves a sudden, evasive maneuver (swerving) to avoid a car merging into its lane, which constitutes a sudden and unexpected event. Such reactive behavior indicates an unpredictable traffic interaction that may require human intervention to ensure safety, especially if the merging vehicle's behavior was erratic or unanticipated."
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sq8geewpqu/samples-1k/01d25bbc-a9f903ba.mov,21,0s - 2.0s,The car has slowed to a stop,"The action is performed for an unknown reason, indicating an ambiguous or potentially unsafe situation where the vehicle's decision-making is unclear, which meets the criteria for requiring a human takeover."
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sq8geewpqu/samples-1k/01d25bbc-a9f903ba.mov,21,3.0s - 8.0s,The car is stopped on the side of the road,"The vehicle is stopped on the side of the road for an unknown reason, representing an uncertain and potentially unsafe behavior that does not align with normal driving patterns, thus requiring human intervention."
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sq8geewpqu/samples-1k/06e4a00e-9ed56776.mov,22,0s - 12.0s,The car is stopped,"The car stops for an unknown reason, which constitutes an ambiguous situation where the vehicle's behavior lacks a clear justification. This uncertainty meets the ""Ambiguous or Unsafe Situations"" criterion, requiring a human driver to take over to ensure safety and understand the cause of the stop."
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sq8geewpqu/samples-1k/06ec79fd-3351771d.mov,42,3.0s - 20.0s,The car is stopped,"The vehicle stops for an unknown reason, which constitutes an ambiguous situation where the system's behavior is not justified. This lack of clarity could indicate a malfunction or misperception, requiring human intervention to ensure safety."
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sq8geewpqu/samples-1k/00091078-878e079e.mov,47,13.0s - 19.0s,The car is speeding down the wrong side of the street,"This action involves risky behavior by driving on the wrong side of the road, which creates an unsafe and potentially illegal situation. It indicates a significant deviation from normal traffic rules and could endanger oncoming traffic, especially if visibility is limited or other vehicles are approaching. Such behavior reflects an ambiguous and unsafe scenario that requires immediate human intervention."
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sq8geewpqu/samples-1k/00091078-878e079e.mov,47,20.0s - 23.0s,The car is braking hard and pulling to the right,"The hard braking combined with an evasive maneuver suggests a sudden, unexpected event caused by a prior risky decision (driving on the wrong side of the street). This abrupt action to avoid a collision indicates a loss of safe operational control and high environmental complexity due to proximity to traffic, meeting the criteria for a takeover."
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sq8geewpqu/samples-1k/053dc1d6-29b58579.mov,49,27.0s - 40.0s,The car is driving slowly down the street,"This scenario involves high environmental complexity due to snow banks partially blocking the lane, which affects road geometry and visibility, combined with pedestrians actively crossing the street ahead. These conditions represent adverse weather-related infrastructure challenges and interaction with vulnerable road users, requiring careful navigation that may exceed the autonomous system's capabilities, thus necessitating a human takeover."
